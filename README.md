üéì Student Attendance System - Final Year Project üìö

üìù Executive Summary
----------------------
The Student Attendance System using deep entity naming technique is a powerful and cost-effective solution for automating student attendance management. By combining deep learning and image processing technologies, the system detects and recognizes student faces, extracts facial features using the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) algorithm, and utilizes supervised learning for accurate identification.

üìñ Chapter 1: Introduction
---------------------------
üéì Welcome to the Student Attendance System, my Final Year Project (FYP) - an innovative solution to automate and streamline student attendance management. This project represents the culmination of my academic journey, combining cutting-edge technologies and modern methodologies to revolutionize the traditional attendance recording process. Join me on this exciting journey to transform attendance management in educational institutions!

In traditional attendance management systems, teachers often spend a significant amount of time manually calling out student names and marking attendance. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors. The goal of this project is to automate and streamline the attendance recording process by leveraging facial recognition technology. By using a digital camera to detect and recognize faces, the system compares the detected faces with the stored student images in the database. Once a match is found, the attendance is marked, and the attendance record is stored in the database. The system is capable of marking the attendance of multiple students simultaneously, leading to significant time savings for teachers. Additionally, the system generates monthly reports for easy attendance tracking and management.

üåê Background
--------------
Facial recognition technology has been widely adopted in various industries, including offices for employee attendance management and mobile phones for enhanced password security. The Student Attendance System builds upon these advancements, bringing the same level of accuracy and convenience to student attendance management. By leveraging facial recognition, the system improves efficiency, eliminates manual errors, and provides a secure and reliable method for marking student attendance.
